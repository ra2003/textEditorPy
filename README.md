# textEditorPy

Hello! This is a simple text editor. You can use this just like NotePad.

### Requirements
- Python (I used Python 3.8.5)
- A code editor 
- A desktop or laptop
- Some time?

### How to do it?
- First, download all the code. You can simply download this repository or use Git.
- Then, install tkinter using `pip install tkinter` in the console. (Or maybe its already installed by default?)
- Now, run the code. You should see a new window open, called TextEditor.
### And there you have it! A simple text editor!
